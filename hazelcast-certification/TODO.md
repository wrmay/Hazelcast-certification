# To Do

- move hard-coded map names to a Constants file.
- reorganize packages
- have the ansible setup task render a local  hazelcast-client.xml 
- have the ansible setup task echo mancenter URL
- add cluster start and stop commands (start would need to be done via ansible)
- Don't need CreditCardKey any more
